# QRGen

In Stores and supermarkets every item has a QR code. These QR codes are created for unique identification for the products. When we enter the billing section the person in billing counter would scan the QR code for the information hidden in the QR code. 

QRgen is a qr code generation web application developed using python flask framework. This application runs in browser. Using qrgen we could create qr codes for an item in a bulk order sequentially.
